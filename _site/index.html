      [Cross-posted with minor changes from the Scholars’ Lab] In a recent PMLA issue on digital methods, Johanna Drucker concludes her article “Why Distant Reading Isn’t” by claiming that distant reading’s literalness makes it the closest form of reading imaginable. What distant reading lacks is distance. That distance is critical; it is the space between the literal text and the virtual text, between the inscriptional, notational surface and the rhetorical, cognitive effect that produces a text. (633) In other words, when an algorithm “reads” a corpus by scouring it for patterns of one kind or another, it doesn’t transform the text...<br>

      [Cross-posted with minor changes from the Scholars’ Lab] Amiri Baraka’s Black Magic, 1969 In this post I’ll discuss my initial foray into natural language processing (NLP)—cleaning up a corpus and prepping it for some basic text analysis techniques. I want to begin, however, with a note on the small textual corpus that I’m using in these preliminary explorations—Black Magic, a 1969 collection of three books of poetry by Amiri Baraka. In a prefatory note to the collection, Baraka offers an “Explanation of the Work” that touches on the three books of poetry contained within. “Sabotage,” he writes of the first...<br>

      [Cross-posted from the Scholars’ Lab] As one of the graduate fellows at the Scholars’ Lab this year, I am working on a year-long digital project (that’s also a chapter of my dissertation) in collaboration with the folks at the SLab. To sum it up in a sentence, the project hopes to offer a proof-of-concept for performing sentiment analysis on some of the most politically and affectively charged poetry of the 20th century, that of the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 70s. Today I wanted to post a brief overview and introduction to what I’m working on. For some...<br>
