**Dissertation**

“The Radical Sensibility: Cultures of Discontent in American Literature after 1934” reframes how scholars of affect and American literature understand feelings associated with radical discontent in the context of recent US literary history. Pursuing a pattern of discontent from the 1930s, through the 60s, and into the present, I argue that a uniquely radical sensibility becomes a persistent element of how American cultural formations articulate injustice. I use this lens to put the radical Marxist critics of the 1930s, such as the writers at a journal like Partisan Review, into conversation with revolutionary poetry from Black Arts Movement in the 1960s, as well as with a constellation of Native American novelists in the present, particularly Louise Erdrich and Sherman Alexie. Over the course of the century, in short, this sensibility gives shape to the ways in which aesthetic objects are mobilized to address political issues.
